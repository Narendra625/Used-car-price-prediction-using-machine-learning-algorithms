# Used car price prediction using machine learning algorithms

The focus of this project is to develop machine learning models that 
can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features. In 
this project, we investigate supervised machine learning models to 
predict the price of used cars in India. The predictions are based on 
historical data of car details, taken from CarDekho.com. Different 
models like Random Forest, Extra Tree Regressor, Bagging 
Regressor and Decision Tree have been used to make the predictions. 
The predictions are then compared in order to find those which 
provide the best performances. All four methods provided 
comparable performance. The number of different attributes is 
measured, and also it has been considered to predict a more reliable 
and accurate result. We also compared the prediction accuracy of 
these models to determine the best one. Our results show that the 
Random Forest model yields the best result.
